vim config
==========

This repository contains my Vim config just for convenience in making the copy
of it.

After cloning, it is necessary to install NeoBundle_. Possibly the easiest way
to make it (as described in the NeoBundle README file) is like this:

.. code:: shell-session

   $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim/master/bin/install.sh | sh


.. _NeoBundle: https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim
