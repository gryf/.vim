vim config
==========

This repository contains my Vim config just for convenience in making the copy
of it.

It uses `vim-plug`_ plugin manager, so after cloning, just open vim, and it
will automatically install all the plugins.

It should be cloned as is into `$HOME`` directory, i.e:

.. code:: console

   cd $HOME
   git clone https://github.com/gryf/.vim

or in ``$XDG_COFIG_HOME`` directory, which usually is set to ``$HOME/.config``:

.. code:: console

   git clone https://github.com/gryf/.vim ~/.config/vim

.. _vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
